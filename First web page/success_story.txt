As an operations engineer in an effluent treatment plant, I was tasked with improving the efficiency and reducing the costs of our wastewater treatment process. After analyzing the data and identifying key areas for improvement, I implemented a series of operational changes that led to a significant reduction in our energy consumption and chemical usage. Through implementing these changes, we were able to achieve only 10% reduction in operational costs on paper and a 17% improvement in our effluent quality. These results not only had a positive impact on our bottom line but also a motivation for others to improve and contribute in growth of department. I am proud to have played a key role in these improvements, and it reinforced the importance of
of continuous improvement and data-driven decision making in operations engineering.
